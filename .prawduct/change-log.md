# Change Log — bankmachine

<!-- Append new entries at the top. Each entry is a ## section.

     # Tagged entries

     This file is PROSE. Its body is what a reader — and a release note —
     actually gets. Two machine-read keys ride in a tag-line directly under
     the ## header, and `check-releasability` is the only thing that reads
     them:

         ## YYYY-MM-DD: title (vN.M.P)

         <!-- prawduct: scope=v1.4 | release=v1.3.18 -->

         **Why:** ...

     Recognized keys:
       scope    - rollup identifier (e.g., v1.4), matching the `scope:`
                  frontmatter of the build plan that governs the work.
       release  - the version that carried this entry. Its ABSENCE is what
                  marks the entry release-pending, so write NO release= on
                  the feature branch and add it at release. Any value at all
                  — including a placeholder naming the absence, e.g.
                  `release=unreleased` — drops the whole scope out of the
                  release-pending set and silently unships the work.

     Nothing else is read. `chunks=` and `status=` were retired along with the
     derived views they fed; entries in older logs still carry them and are
     parsed as inert — leave them. Which chunks an entry shipped belongs in
     the entry BODY, where release notes and readers actually find it: a
     deliverable omitted from the body ships invisibly, and no tag ever
     caught that either. -->

## 2026-09-05: Named — the product is `bankmachine`

<!-- prawduct: scope=rename -->

**Why:** The working name embedded a third-party trademark and locked the product to one
aggregator, and build step 1 is what fixes the Python package name, the keychain service name, the
scheduler label and the MCP server name. The keychain service name is the expensive one — changing
it after enrollment orphans stored access tokens. Settling the name while the repository still held
**zero lines of code** made this a documentation sweep rather than a migration; that timing was the
whole point of deciding the rename before step 1 rather than at publish.

Verified rather than assumed: PyPI returned 404 for `bankmachine`, so the package name was free at
the time of choosing.

**What changed:** titles and labels across the requirements doc, README, change-log, backlog,
boundary patterns and project-state; the name open questions in `system-requirements.md` §9 and
`project-state.yaml` closed; the aggregator-pluggability question's stale clause corrected, since
the product name no longer embeds the aggregator's name — one fewer reason that question is forced.

Six occurrences of the old name were deliberately **left in place**: two historical change-log and
archived-plan entries that record what was said on the day, the decision entry that names what was
renamed away from, and the GitHub repository slug, which is still accurate because the remote has
not been renamed.

**Carried through to the remote and the checkout.** The GitHub repository was renamed
`brookstalley/MCPlaid` → `brookstalley/bankmachine` (verified still private), `backlog_service_repo`
repointed at it rather than left to lean on GitHub's redirect, and the local checkout moved to
`~/source/bankmachine`. Verified after the move that `core.hooksPath` survived, the guard is clean,
the self-test still passes 22/22, and both branches are in sync with the renamed remote.

**Recorded caveat, raised once and accepted.** "Bank machine" is the ordinary term for an ATM in
Canada and parts of the UK — a name suggesting a device that *dispenses money*, for a product whose
§2 non-goals make "read-only, permanently" a headline commitment. This is a connotation risk, not a
technical one, and the mitigation is placement rather than a different name: the README now leads
with **"Read-only. It never moves money"** above the description, where a reader arriving from the
name meets the correction first.

## 2026-09-05: Repository made publishable — roster out of git, history purged, boundary guarded

<!-- prawduct: scope=repo-sanitization -->

**Why:** The operator restated the product. MCPlaid is a **general-purpose tool, not linked to
their personal finances** — consumed by Claude Cowork, and possibly released publicly, so nothing
specific to them may be in it. That resolved the open question the previous entry left standing,
and resolved it harder than either option on the table: the roster does not belong in this
repository at all.

The exposure was measured rather than estimated. `origin/develop` carried the operator's
institution names and balances in exactly three paths, and every other tracked file at that ref
was grepped clean.

**What changed:**

- The roster and its account-inventory evidence moved to the gitignored `deployment/` directory.
  `docs/deployment-requirements.template.md` keeps what was worth keeping — the zero-engine-change
  contract and the §7 traceability table — with no institution, balance or account count in it.
  That contract is what makes the engine spec trustworthy to a reader who is not this operator.
- `docs/build-vs-adopt-investigation.md` sanitized in place: operator name, machine name,
  institution names and account counts out; every technical finding, including the source-level
  vetting of the candidate MCP servers, kept intact.
- `scripts/check-no-personal-data.sh` added and wired into `pre-push` on **every** branch. It
  matches the roster's own explicit tokens (engine AC-0.3) plus operator identity, on word
  boundaries, over every tracked file. A checkout with no `deployment/` directory has no roster to
  leak and passes with a note — which is why the guard itself is safe to publish.
- `README.md` added, carrying the `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` step. A hooks directory is
  per-clone config, so a fresh clone pushes unguarded and nothing says so — and the only previous
  statement of the step lived inside the hook file the unset config prevents from running.
- **No attribution, anywhere** — stated absolutely in `CLAUDE.md` and homed as a norm row in
  `project-preferences.md`. This widens the already-ratified `Commit attribution: none` past
  commits to PRs, issues, comments, code, docstrings, documentation and release notes, and it
  overrides any harness default to the contrary. Recorded here because the widening previously
  existed only in `CLAUDE.md` while the preferences row still read narrower.
- **History purged.** `git filter-repo` removed five paths from every commit; `develop` and `main`
  were force-pushed. Verified by fresh clone: zero institution or operator tokens anywhere in the
  remote's history. Two paths were purged and re-added at their current content rather than
  scrubbed in place — the decision record and the guard itself, both of which carried in early
  revisions exactly what the purge exists to remove.
- **The fifth path was found by the guard, not by us.** The purge was planned as four paths. The
  finished guard, scanning all history, reported a fifth: Chunk 01's own first commit hardcoded
  identity tokens in the guard's source — the arrangement the Critic's R-9 had just made us
  remove. The check caught its author.
- Four decisions recorded with alternatives: repository scope; MCP transport is local stdio only
  and AC-10.5 holds; macOS for v1 with the credential store and scheduler behind seams; rename
  before build step 1.

**What the review changed, and it was the important half.** The first version of this guard
scanned the *working tree*. Critic pointed out that this passes the exact exposure the guard exists
to stop — a leak sitting in already-pushed history behind a sanitized tip — and that the operator
would read "clean" as "nothing I am pushing carries the roster", which was not what was checked. The
guard now takes the ref range the pre-push hook already receives and scans **every commit being
pushed**. Run against this repository's own history it correctly refuses: the roster is still back
there, which is what Chunk 02 is for.

The same review found the guard failed open at every error path, and that its hardcoded identity
tokens forced a carve-out where the one tracked file containing the operator's name was the one file
never scanned. Both are fixed by construction rather than by patching: **all** tokens now come from
gitignored `deployment/`, so the script carries none and needs no self-exclusion, and every error
condition aborts rather than reporting clean.

**The self-test earned itself immediately: 7 of its 15 cases failed on first run.** The cause was a
genuine defect — the positive control used system `grep` while the scan used `git grep`, which does
not honour `\b` in ERE. So the control passed while the scan matched nothing: precisely the
fail-open shape the guard was being rewritten to refuse, reproduced inside the fix. Word boundaries
are now spelled out explicitly, and the control runs through the same engine that scans, using a
real token rather than a synthetic sentinel.

**Note on the mechanism.** Guard and self-test are shell rather than `tests/preferences/` because no
Python scaffold exists yet and creating one would fix the package name ahead of the rename decision.
The migration obligation is recorded in `project-preferences.md` and in `system-requirements.md` §8
build step 1 — the step that lands the test runner, and therefore the moment it is triggered.

## 2026-09-05: Discovery captured; requirements split into engine and roster layers

**Why:** The repo held three substantial docs but a template-default `project-state.yaml`, so
governance could not calibrate rigor and the build gates could not engage. Discovery ran in
reconciliation mode — the material was read and backfilled rather than re-interviewed.

Mid-discovery the operator imposed a constraint that reshaped the frame: **no hardcoded account
providers; accounts are added and removed over the product's life.** The requirements doc was a
snapshot of one roster on one day, and that roster was already known wrong in detail. The operator's
own refinement settled where the line falls — the roster requirements are *genuine* requirements,
they simply belong to a different layer than the engine.

**What changed:**

- The v1 acceptance-criteria document split into `docs/system-requirements.md` (the
  provider-agnostic engine, no institution name in it) and a deployment-requirements document
  holding this operator's roster, as real acceptance criteria. All 47 v1 criteria land in one or
  the other, generalized or instantiated; one is explicitly superseded.
- A load-bearing rule connects them: every deployment requirement must be satisfiable by
  configuration plus an adapter with zero engine change. The traceability table is its checkable
  form — a deployment requirement that cannot be expressed that way is a gap in the engine spec.
- Two norms ratified: the provider-agnostic engine (with the aggregator expressly carved out), and
  uniqueness of requirement ids within a document.
- Decisions recorded with alternatives: SQLCipher over plain SQLite and over field-level AES;
  no hardcoded filesystem paths; lossless rebuild qualified by a recorded derivation version;
  account lifecycle so a retired account stops reading as a permanent coverage gap.
- Toolchain set: uv, pytest, ruff, mypy strict, hypothesis on the money and idempotency invariants.

**Open, and the operator's to decide:** where the roster lives. `origin/develop` already carries
institution names and balances, against the constraint this project records; the remote is private.
*(Closed 2026-09-05 by the entry above this one: the roster moved out of git and the history was
rewritten.)*

**Reviewed:** `rev-20260905T195208Z-c1f3c450` (2 blocking, 9 warning, 5 note — all resolved),
verified clean by `rev-20260905T200406Z-290b9dcb`.
